            <li>
                <p>A GET to "/games will bring you a JSON with all the Games on the DB (JSON file on the Static

                <p>A PUT to "/games/{GameId}" with a proper JSON object would let you update a new Game to the DB.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A DELETE to "/games/{GameId}" will Delete the game which GameId is related to.
